Transform written scripts into professional animated videos with AI. Story Flow automates the entire video creation process—from scene generation and voiceovers to final assembly—making high-quality video content accessible to everyone.

## 📖 Overview

Story Flow is built for content creators, marketers, educators, and small business owners who need to produce engaging video content without the time, cost, or technical skills of traditional video production. By leveraging a state-of-the-art AI stack, our platform turns a simple text script into a polished, animated video in minutes.

This project follows a "PRD-First" methodology. The entire application is a live, interactive version of the technical guide generated by an expert AI architect.
