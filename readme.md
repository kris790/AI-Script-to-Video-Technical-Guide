# AI Script-to-Video Technical Guide

## Overview

This project is a web application that serves as a comprehensive technical guide and implementation plan for building an AI-powered script-to-video automation tool. It's designed as if an expert AI consultant and technical architect has analyzed a Product Requirements Document (PRD) and provided a detailed roadmap for an MVP.

The guide itself is generated by an AI assistant (Gemini) to showcase a deep understanding of system architecture, API integration, cost optimization, and risk management for building modern AI applications.

## Features (Guide Sections)

The interactive guide is broken down into the following detailed sections:

-   **Roadmap**: A 4-week implementation plan with weekly milestones for building the MVP.
-   **Architecture**: A system architecture diagram and explanation of the component interactions and data flow.
-   **API Strategy**: Specific guidance on integrating the Gemini API suite for script analysis, image generation, text-to-speech, and video assembly.
-   **Database Schema**: A proposed PostgreSQL schema for storing user data, scripts, and video metadata.
-   **Cost Optimization**: Strategies to minimize AI pipeline costs without sacrificing quality.
-   **Risk Mitigation**: Identification of technical risks and actionable strategies to address them.
-   **Code Samples**: Practical code snippets for key backend and frontend functionalities, including asynchronous job processing and drag-and-drop UI implementation.

## Technology Stack (of this Application)

This guide application is built with modern frontend technologies:

-   **Framework**: React
-   **Language**: TypeScript
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to provide a realistic and detailed technical blueprint for developers looking to build AI-powered applications. It serves as both a practical guide for a "Script-to-Video" tool and a demonstration of how AI can be leveraged for complex technical planning and documentation.
